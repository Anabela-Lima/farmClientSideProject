# Farm Tycoon

A fun farming simulator; plant & harvest crops, earn money, and become a farming tycoon!

## The Project Description 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and acts as the front end appplication to a given farm game server-side API. Focusing on javaScript, React, HTML and CSS, this project aims to bring to life the vision of the back end team. 

Farm Tycoon gives users the ability to enjoy a fantasy world where they are in control of their own farms.

In the wireframe, both individual and reusable components were identified before the overall page was further broken down into more distinct sections (header, containers, footer etc) for more in depth decriptions.

### How to make the most of this project 

 This application allows you to take on the role of a farm tycoon, buying fields and crops to sell and become rich! 

The first step is to create your own farm, or build on one of those already set in the game.
You are then able to go to the marketplace to purchase your choice of fields which will be sent down to the selected farms. From there, you can purchase the crop that you wish to harvest in your fields. After 20 ‘days’, your crops will be ready to sell of and in exchange, your money counter will increase.
